Tutorial-1 
 
1) Three  unbiased  coins  are  tossed.  Find  the  probability  of  getting  (i)  exactly 
two  heads,  (ii)  at  least  one  tail,  (iii)  at  most  two  heads,  (iv)  a  head  on  the 
second coin, and (v) exactly two heads in succession.  
2) From a collection of 10 bulbs, of which 4 are defective, 3 bulbs are selected 
at random and fitted into lamps. Find the probability that (i) all three bulbs 
glow, and (ii) the room is lit.  
3)  A  card  is  drawn  from  a  pack  of  52  cards.  Find  the  probability  of  getting  a 
king or a heart or a red card.  
4)  A  bag  contains  3  red  and  4  white  balls.  Two  draws  are  made  without 
replacement. What is the probability that both the balls are red?  
5)  A  businessman  goes  to  hotels  X,  Y,  Z  for  20%,  50%,  30%  of  the  time 
respectively. It is known that 5%, 4%, 8% of the rooms in X, Y, Z hotels have 
faulty  plumbings.  What  is  the  probability  that  the  businessman’s room 
having faulty plumbing is assigned to Hotel Z?  
6)   A fair die is tossed once. If the random variable is getting an even number, 
find the probability distribution of X.

7) A  fair  dice  is  tossed.  Let  the  random  variable  X  denote  the  twice  the 
 number  appearing  on  the  dice.  Write  the  probability  distribution  of  X. 
  
8) Two unbiased dice are thrown at random. Find the probability distribution 
 of the sum of the numbers on them.

          is a Probability Density Function for a random variable. Hence, find P(3<x<10) 
10) An unbiased coin is tosses 6 times. Find the probability of getting (i) 
exactly 4 tails; (ii) at least 4 tails. 
11) The  probability  that  a  pen  manufactured  by  a  company  will  be 
defective is 1/10. If  12  such  pens  are  manufactured,  find  the  probability 
that 
1) Exactly two will be defective 
2) At least two will be defective 
3) None will be defective 
12) Let  X  be  a  Poisson  variate  with

13) 100 electric bulbs are found to be defective in a lot of 500 bulbs. Use 
Poisson  distribution  to  find  the  probability  that  at  most  3  bulbs   are 
defective in a box of 100 bulbs. [Use
